It was an absolute honor to receive the best student paper award at a conference that I have been looking at as the "what is the latest and greatest research" conference since the start of my PhD. The lineup is full of people that are huglely competent and sfull of people I aspire to be more like. Having received some cash and a free registration, I decided to use my PhD funding to cover the rest of the expenses (hotel). 
Below is a short day-by-day account of my trip- primarily for friends and family that I neglected to reply to, but also for anyone who is considering going in the coming years!

## Prep: 
Other than preparing material for the conference itself and selling a kidney to be able to afford the hotel in Hawaii (lol to the people renting the back of their RVs for 180$/ight), I also pre-jet-lagged myself. I woke up 2 hours earlier each day for a week prior. Note that I could have been waking up 2 hours later, but I only realized this upon waking up at 0420 after the first day. It was now closer to Hawaii time going back around the clock so I had to commit to the early mornings.
I received ample bullying from a number of friends and family that believed that I was out of my mind for doing this.

## Day 0:
I landed in Los Angeles at 1330 and prompty made my way to the Skyways hotel. After collecting my key from the lady behind the bullet proof glass, it dawned on me why this place was called skyways- because it was in the way of basically all of LAXs sky traffic. 
Ditched the suitcase and made my way to Venice Beach. I was flattered that the Mexican lady at the beach thought that I looked Mexican enough to ask me whether I was having my food para llevar. The inexistent public transport system in LA meant that I had to take a 40$ Uber to get to the beach and another one back. Plus the 20$ on the food, that was 100$ guzzled away in about 2 hours. Welcome to America.
My taxi driver explained to me that he used to work on a Libyan cargo ship in the 80's and that he had escaped in the middle of the night whilst the boat was docked in New York. He initially intended to escape to Canada but was scared off by the snow so he got back on the boat to New York. He got off the boat and was greeted with equal amounts of snow ("this again!?" he said) so he took a series of buses to LA. He had been driving taxis ever since.

## Day 1:
Woke up at 0530 to take my second flight (LA-Maui) and debated whether I should walk to the airport from the hotel. Not wanting to further injure my foot I decided on booking an Uber. 25$ please. 
Wanting to replicate the delicious mexican food of the day prior I found a breakfast quesedilla at the airport. I still feel sick thinking about it. The three different cheeses were oozing milk and the whole thing just disintegrated in my hands. 20$. I spent the rest of the day contemplating the many health benefits of fasting. 
Landed in Maui after a 5:30 flight. I made my way to the hotel by bus (90 mins), dropped my bags and purchased a shave ice- thoroughly disappointing. Basically just ice with syrup. 

## Day 2: 
Woke up at 0515 to pee and realized the view of the stars in Maui would probably be excellent- jumped out of bed and ran down to the beach only to discover that it was pretty much overcast and there wasn't much for me to see. So I waited an hour on the beach for the sun to rise and went for a swim. Found the local caffe and got avocado on toast and my first real espresso of the trip. A "Men of the Islands" calendar caught the side of my eye in a gift shop so I decided to purchase it for my friend.
