I’ve always been drawn to history and adventure books, not just for the fact they provide the backstory of the world we currently live in, but for the glimpse they give into how human beings, in eras and places far removed from ours, have faced seemingly insurmountable challenges. Whether they’re crossing unexplored lands or battling the enemy through the desert, every major victory is built from countless smaller ones.

Those “micro-victories” are a reminder that everyone's journey requires puzzling through obstacles, reshaping our surroundings, and inching forward. Progress rarely arrives in one grand epiphany; it’s a combination of those subtle shifts in understanding and those experiment that doen’t fail but teach you something unexpected.

So, whilst I'm not battling the Afrika Korps across the Libyan desert, I thought I would still share my (hopefully) growing archive of “where I was” and “what I was doing” each time I felt something click (and I remembered to record it...). For researchers, it's often citation count and publication number that are our external measure of impact, but for me, it’s these quiet advances that provide the research journey all its meaning!
