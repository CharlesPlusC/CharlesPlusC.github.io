I’ve always been drawn to history and adventure books, not just for the fact they provide the backstory of the world we currently live in, but for the glimpse they give into how human beings, in eras and places far removed from ours, have faced seemingly insurmountable challenges. Whether they’re crossing unexplored lands or battling the enemy through the desert, every major victory is built from countless smaller ones.

Those “micro-victories” are a reminder that every human's journey follows the same instinct to puzzle through obstacles, reshape our surroundings, and inch forward. Progress rarely arrives in one grand epiphany; it’s woven from those subtle shifts in understanding, the experiment that doesn’t fail but teaches you something unexpected.

So here is a (hopefully) growing archive of “where I was” and “what I was doing” each time I felt something click (and I remembered to record it...). Because while, for researchers, citation count and publication numbers measure are our external measure of impact, it’s these quiet advances that really matter.
