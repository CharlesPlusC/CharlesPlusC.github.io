### Astrodynamics and Geodesy Research Student

Hello there! I'm on an exciting journey at UCL's Space Geodesy and Navigation Laboratory (SGNL), guided by the insightful Professor Marek Ziebart and Dr. Santosh Bhattarai. My focus? The fascinating interplay between Spaceflight Dynamics and Geodesy.

Before diving into the world of academia, I explored our beautiful Earth as a professional cyclist, soaking in its varied landscapes. But the mesmerizing pull of the cosmos led me to a different path. Today, I dedicate my efforts to understanding the complexities of spaceflight and the intricate patterns of spacecraft motion.

I approach my work with a multidisciplinary background, encompassing engineering, physical geography, and data science. This combination allows me to investigate the dynamics of satellites, particularly as we enter the promising era of mega-constellations. Presently, I'm delving into advanced non-conservative force modeling, aiming to refine orbit solutions, which could revolutionize collision prevention, space debris management, and satellite navigation.

Whether you share a passion for spacecraft or are keen to discuss the latest in space news, I'd be thrilled to connect.
