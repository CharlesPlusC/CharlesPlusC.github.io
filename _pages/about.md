Hello there! I'm on an exciting journey at UCL's Space Geodesy and Navigation Laboratory (SGNL), guided by the insightful Professor Marek Ziebart and Dr. Santosh Bhattarai. My research focuses on the applications of astrodynamics and space geodesy techniques to space domain awareness.

Before diving into the world of academia, I explored our beautiful Earth as a professional cyclist, soaking in its varied landscapes. But the mesmerizing pull of the cosmos led me to a different path. Today, I spend most of my days nerding out about spaceflight. In particular, I make high-fidelity physics-driven simulations of spacecraft motion, aiming to refine orbit solutions, which could revolutionize collision prevention, space traffic management, and satellite navigation.

This website is a collection of my research topics, projects, and thoughts.

Whether you share a passion for spacecraft or are keen to discuss the latest in space news, I'd be thrilled to connect.
