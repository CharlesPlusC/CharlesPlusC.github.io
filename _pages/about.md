Welcome, fellow seekers of the infinite expanse! 
I am a PhD candidate in Spaceflight Dynamics and Geodesy, studying at UCL's Space Geodesy and Navigation laboratory under the watchful gaze of Professor Marek Ziebart and Dr. Santosh Bhattarai.

In a previous life, I roamed the winding roads of the world as a professional cyclist, but my true calling was written among the stars. Now, I spend my days delving into the mysteries of spaceflight, seeking to unlock the secrets of spacecraft motion. 

With a background in engineering, physical geography, and data science, I bring a unique perspective to my research on the dynamics and coordination of satellites amidst the rise of mega-constellations. Currently, I am dedicated to leveraging state-of-the-art non-conservative force modeling to optimize mega constellation management. 

If you share my passion for studying the mysteries of spaceflight and unlocking the secrets of spacecraft motion, or just want to chat about the latest space news, please don't hesitate to get in touch. The universe awaits us!
