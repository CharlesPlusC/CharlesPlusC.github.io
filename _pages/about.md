Hi, I'm Charles. Iâ€™m a PhD student in Space Flight Dynamics and Geodesy at University College London.

My research is all about making space operations safer, from improving collision avoidance and radiation force modeling to using the increasing number of spacecraft in orbit to invert for the structure of the atmosphere. I'm eager to apply my work to real-world satellite operations.

On this website you will find a (largely incomplete and out of date) repository of my research and some blog posts that I post inconsistently. If you would like ask about collaborating or are simply curious to know more about the research on here, please feel free to reach out!
