### Astrodynamics and Geodesy Research Student

Greetings, fellow space explorers! I'm currently navigating the academic cosmos as a PhD candidate at UCL's Space Geodesy and Navigation Laboratory (SGNL), mentored by Professor Marek Ziebart and Dr. Santosh Bhattarai. My research orbits around Spaceflight Dynamics and Geodesy.

Before academia, I pedaled through life as a professional cyclist, journeying across our planet's diverse terrains. Yet, the allure of the stars was irresistible. Now, I channel my energy into deciphering the enigmas of spaceflight and the dance of spacecraft motion.

My toolkit? A fusion of engineering, physical geography, and data science degrees. This unique blend fuels my research on the choreography of satellites, especially amidst the burgeoning era of mega-constellations. I'm currently harnessing cutting-edge non-conservative force modeling to improve orbit solutions. This has implications for collision avoidance, space debris mitigation, and satellite navigation.

If you're intrigued by the ballet of spacecraft motion, or simply wish to exchange thoughts on the latest space headlines, I'd love to hear from you. Let's traverse the cosmic frontier together!
