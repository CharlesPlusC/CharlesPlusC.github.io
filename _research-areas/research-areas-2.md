Within the research group, part of our work is focused on communicating the challenges associated with mega-constellations. Usually words and numbers are not enough to convey the scale of the problem. I have a developped a set of visualizations to aid me in easily conveying different information about mega-constellations. The visualizations are based on the NORAD TLE data and are updated semi-regularly. Here are some examples:
