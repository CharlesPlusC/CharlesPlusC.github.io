At UCL, our research also delves into medium-term modelling of space behavior (0-25 yrs). Central to our analysis is the use of "source-sink evolutionary models", which are pivotal for assessing potential scenarios, formulating policies, predicting trends, and understanding launch patterns.

Examples of their use has been to tackle questions such as: 
- How would the space environment change if the E-Space constellation, with over 500,000 satellites, were to materialize? 
- What is the best location for radar facilities to track the upcoming defense and communications LEO constellations?

Enter the Future Space Populations (FSP) Tool - our solution in the making. This tool is crafted not just to answer such complex questions but also to present the insights visually and interactively.

I am personally involved in writing the code behind the models but the UCL Future Space Populations tool also has a web-based [interface] (https://fsp-visualizer.netlify.app/). With it, you can journey through space populations of the past, revel in the present, and leap into various predicted futures.

In our quest to promote space sustainability and make it interdisciplinary, we're excited to announce that the FSP tool is now open source. If the universe of space modelling intrigues you, hop on board and contribute. While it's still a nascent project, we're gearing up for an official launch soon.

To collaborate or learn more, explore the FSP Simulator's repository [here](https://github.com/ucl-sgnl/FSPSimulator). We'd love to journey with fellow space enthusiasts like you!
