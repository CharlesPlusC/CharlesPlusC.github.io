The research presented in this study focuses on the impact of higher-fidelity aerodynamic drag modelling in the orbit propagation process for spacecraft in low Earth orbit. The research involved developing a custom 3D aerodynamic drag model and comparing it to the 1D 'canonball' model currently in use by the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) for orbit propagation. The study was conducted using data from a subset of the OneWeb mega-constellation, covering around 40% of the total constellation.

The results of the study show that there are significant differences in the orbital parameters generated by the 3D and 1D models. In particular, the study found that the 3D model corrects a secular effect that could impact the orbit propagation process on the order of tens of meters within 12 hours. For groups such as JSpOC, this magnitude of difference impacts their ability to deliver meaningful conjunction warnings to spacecraft operators in LEO. For mega-constellation operators, such effects will impact the evolution of constellation geometry which will influence their station-keeping regime. Making the required corrections has implications for the constellation lifetime as it directly impacts fuel consumption.

The study also highlights the relative simplicity of including higher-fidelity aerodynamic drag within orbit propagators. Whilst the results of the 3D model are of higher physical-fidelity than the 1D model, it is not yet possible to say whether they are closer to the ``truth". Nonetheless, the results still demonstrate the potential impacts of higher physical fidelity aerodynamic drag modelling.

The study also emphasizes the complexity of modelling the atmospheric density in the orbit propagation process. The size of uncertainties in the atmospheric density modelling problem overshadow many other aspects of the orbit propagation process. Any work seeking to explore the problem of aerodynamic drag modelling would be wise to use one of the most commonly implemented atmospheric density models for comparability across the literature (NRLMSISE-00 or JB08).

The study indicates that current drag modelling methods underlying operational systems are likely too coarse and a potential culprit behind the high false-positive rate of conjunction warnings. For mega-constellation operators, this research indicates that using higher-fidelity drag models will predict the geometry of the spacecraft network more accurately. This will impact upon optimal scheduling of maneuvers and station-keeping.

Suggested future work includes validating the proposed model against "real-world" data to quantify the impact relative to a ground truth. Reducing the computational cost of the propagation process and further understanding the effects of drag on orbital geometry would also be valuable. Including the proposed method (or some variant of it) into a more well-known orbit propagator (i.e., SGP4) would make it available to spacecraft operators "off the shelf."

In conclusion, this study contributes to the understanding of the impacts of higher-fidelity aerodynamic drag modelling in the orbit propagation process for spacecraft in low Earth orbit. The results indicate that higher physical fidelity aerodynamic drag modelling could significantly impact the accuracy of orbit propagation, and that current modelling methods are likely too coarse. The study emphasizes the need for continued research and development in this area to improve space traffic management and the longevity of mega-constellations.
