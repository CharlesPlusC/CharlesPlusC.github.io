This research project formed the basis of my masters thesis. The focus was on evaluating the impact of higher-fidelity aerodynamic drag modelling in the orbit propagation of spacecraft in low Earth orbit. The research involved developing a custom 3D aerodynamic drag model and comparing it to the SGP4 propagation. The study was conducted using data from a subset of the OneWeb mega-constellation, covering around 40% of the total constellation.

The results of the study show that there are significant differences in the orbital parameters generated by the 3D and 1D models. In particular, the study found that the 3D model corrects a secular effect that could impact the orbit propagation process on the order of tens of meters within 12 hours. For groups such as JSpOC, this magnitude of difference impacts their ability to deliver meaningful conjunction warnings to spacecraft operators in LEO. For mega-constellation operators, such effects will impact the evolution of constellation geometry which will influence their station-keeping regime. Making the required corrections has implications for the constellation lifetime as it directly impacts fuel consumption.

The study also highlights the relative simplicity of including higher-fidelity aerodynamic drag within orbit propagators and conversely, the high computational cost associated with modelling the atmospheric density in the orbit propagation process. The size of uncertainties in the atmospheric density modelling problem overshadow many other aspects of the orbit propagation process.

The study indicates that current drag modelling methods underlying operational systems are too coarse and a likely culprit behind the high false-positive rate of conjunction warnings. For mega-constellation operators, this research indicates that using higher-fidelity drag models will predict the geometry of the spacecraft network more accurately. This will impact upon optimal scheduling of maneuvers and station-keeping.

In conclusion, this study contributes to improving our understanding of the impacts of higher-fidelity aerodynamic drag modelling in the orbit propagation process for spacecraft in low Earth orbit. The results indicate that higher physical fidelity aerodynamic drag modelling significantly impact the accuracy of orbit propagation, and that current modelling methods are too coarse. The study emphasizes the need for continued research and development in this area to improve space traffic management and the longevity of mega-constellations.
