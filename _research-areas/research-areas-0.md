This research area focuses on developing advanced force modeling techniques for operational space missions. Our work encompasses the development of sophisticated models to accurately predict and account for various forces acting on spacecraft, including atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure, and other environmental effects that impact orbital dynamics.

The research aims to improve the accuracy of orbital predictions and enhance our understanding of the complex interactions between spacecraft and their environment. This is particularly crucial for missions requiring precise positioning and long-term orbital stability.
